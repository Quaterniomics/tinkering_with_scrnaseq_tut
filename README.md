# tinkering_with_scrnaseq_tut

This was simply having fun while tinkering with my scRNAseq self-study, a domain within bioinformatics I found is quite popular in industry. If I become acquainted with it, it would increase the likelihood of landing a job that requires it. Data analysis is messy and somewhat incoherent (as written, I am tinkering with the values in order to see how the plots change. Consider this a toy example).

I also plan on continuing with the Sanbomics tutorial, which includes not only violin plots and UMAP, but also cell type labeling and differential expression with heat maps. These are also high utility CS skills to get under my belt during my breaks from the MSc program.
